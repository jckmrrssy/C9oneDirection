# Project One Direction (Pod)

Project One Direction was created as a resource for those experiencing possible symptoms of mental health disorders, those who have been formally diagnosed with a mental illness, families seeking information to support a loved one, and the public in general.  As a highly prevalent public health issue, POD aims to increase the rate of successful diagnosis and treatment, and to decrease the stigma, or discrimination, rather, that those with mental health disorders and their families face.
